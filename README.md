Hello..,ðŸ‘‹ This is Ahmad Amin.., A software developer and having the great passion to learn new things about the software development. I have a lot of experience in working multiple stacks. I am a quick learner and have the ability the grasp the new concepts of programming because deep down learning new language is not that hard., what makes the programming hard is building logic.., and I am quite good at Object-oriented programming, Data Structures and algorithm analysis

* I had worked in multiple projects. I had created the search engine in java., using the core concepts of Object-oriented programming that can parse and get the result in less then a second. The total number of documents that my program parse through are over 80,000.
* I am quite a fond of., i.e., I like to work on the Data Structures and Algorithm analysis. Actively take part in the competitive programming competition like Google hash code., code jam, HackerRank etc. 
* Used the cloudinary on some of my rails application (to upload images/avatar) to familiarize myself with the basic cloud storage and how the things work
* I have created some of the micro-saas product and npm packages as well. one of the product is 'custom-form-builder'. Check the repository. basically, the concept is to make the graphs visually then export the code as a React component
 
A details explanation of these projects are listed below (in project section)

Tech stacks that I had worked on. 
C/C++ (for Data Structure and Algorithm construction)
Java, Python, React, Ruby on Rails, Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL ,
HTML5, CSS, JavaScript etc.
